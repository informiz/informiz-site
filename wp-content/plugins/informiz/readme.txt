Embed fun, graphic TL;DR explanations about anything and everything in your posts.

== Description ==
= Informiz - Information Made Accessible =
Informiz.org is a repository of short explanations about things. You may think of it as a graphic TL;DR version of Wikipedia, which you can embed in your website.
The informiz plugin provides your readers with instant access to those explanations - dubbed *informiz* - by associating them with text in your posts. 

= Are you making the most of the information revolution? =
Don't send your readers googling for terms or names they are not familiar with! Simply embed informiz inside the text for them to pop up as they find necessary.
Whether you blog about science, economy, technology or geopolitics - with the informiz plugin your readers will never have to leave your post for complementary information. 

See the plugin in action on the [informiz.org](http://informiz.org/informiz-on-demand/) site!

== Installation ==
1. Upload the informiz folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
3. That's it! The plugin will automatically load on any page where the informiz shortcode is used.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who writes the informiz? =
We all do. You can use any informi available at the informiz.org website as well as post your own.

= Do I have to join the informiz.org community in order to create informiz for my site? =
Nope. You can link directly to your informiz without adding them to the central repository.

= What's your business model? =
Donations. Informiz.org is a non profit open source project. We will never spam you or show you ads.

= What's a landscape? =
The idea behind [landscapes](http://informiz.org/informi/quantum-physics-landscape/) is to demonstrate how different topics relate to each other. E.g. a reader interested in quantum physics may also want to know its applications, or what a *Theory of Everything* is. This type of informi lets the reader navigate a landscape of information, so to speak.

= Why can't I rate the informiz? =
Because it's not implemented yet. The informiz.org site is still work-in-progress. Right now you can only post informiz and link to them with the plugin, but hopefully we'll be able to offer you lots of other cool features soon!


== Screenshots ==
1. On each [informi page](http://informiz.org/informi/teleportation/) at informiz.org you will find an example shortcode for associating it with text in your posts.
2. Copy this shortcode into your post, surrounding the text you want to be associated with the informi.
3. Now, when a reader hovers over the text, the informi dialog will appear.
4. Pressing the informi button will pop up the associated informi.
